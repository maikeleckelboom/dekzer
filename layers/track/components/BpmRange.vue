	<h3>BPM Range</h3>
	<p>
		This option sets the upper and lower limits of the BPM range while analyzing files.
		Selecting the correct range will help to avoid half or double BPM values being calculated.
		For example, if you have tracks that are being analyzed at 140 BPM
		and you want them analyzed at 70, choose 68-135.
