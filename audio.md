### Key Components
- **Master Gain Fader**: Controls the overall output level for all connected decks. Range: -24dB to +24dB.
- **Deck Gain Fader(s)**: Controls the individual level for each deck. Range: -12dB to +12dB.
- **Decks**: There can be 2-4 decks, each with its own gain fader.
- **Connections**: Every deck is connected to the master gain, and all gain changes affect the final output before being sent to the hardware.
